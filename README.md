# routeoptimizationideas
it contains by ideas as a outline
"Passenger transportation companies face challenges in optimizing routes, minimizing travel time, and maximizing seat usage. I developed an AI-powered route optimization system that dynamically selects the most efficient path based on passenger boarding and drop-off points Using Generic Algorithm — operating on a seat-to-seat model.”
This shows:
✔ Real-world problem
✔ Technical relevance
✔ Business impact
. Project Goals and Its highlights:
  what I am Trying to achieve:
•	Optimize routes in real time using AI/ML
•	Reduce fuel cost and idle travel
•	Assign seats intelligently based on pickup/drop locations
•	Improve operational efficiency for transporting passengers
•	Reduce waiting time and travel time
•	Increase utilization of each vehicle (seat-to-seat basis)
